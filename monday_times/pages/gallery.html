<h3>Gallery Article</h3>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic type setting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letterset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including version of Lorem Ipsum Web content is dominated by the "page" concept, its beginnings in an academic setting, and in a setting dominated by type-written pages, the idea of the web was to link directly from one academic paper to another academic paper. This was a completely revolutionary idea in the late 1980s and early 1990s when the best a link could be made was to cite a reference in the midst of a type written paper and name that reference either at the bottom of the page or on the last page of the academic paper. When it was possible for any person to write and own a Mosaic page, the concept of a "home page" blurred the idea of a page. It was possible for anyone to own a "Web page" or a "home page" which in many cases the website contained many physical pages in spite of being called "a page". People often cited their "home page" to provide credentials, links to anything that a person supported, or any other individual content a person wanted to publish. </p>
